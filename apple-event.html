                On Tuesday, Apple hosted another virtual presentation, showcasing both the beautiful scenery of 
                California and a slew of new consumer products, including the expected new line of iPhones and updates 
                to its tiniest tablet.

                While the upgrades were numerous, many of them were predictable, expected and incremental, failing to 
                knock the collective audience’s socks off. The base iPad, the iPad mini, the Apple Watch and the new 
                iPhones all received updated hardware. However, the upgrades were more quantity than quality, and 
                rumored announcements like new AirPods or augmented reality glasses were nowhere to be found.

                Still, the slight updates add up if you’ve been holding off on copping a new Apple device, and they 
                seem particularly intriguing when looking at the company’s smallest devices.

                    More iPhones, more power

                    Like clockwork, Apple has a new line of iPhones. But aside from the diagonally arranged rear dual 
                    cameras and slightly changed color palette, you’d be quite hard-pressed to find something 
                    noticeably different about the iPhone 13, compared to last year’s models. The new A15 Bionic 
                    processor is an expected, but welcome, upgrade to an already lightning-fast phone, speeding up 
                    activities like video processing and live translation.

                    Also on deck for the iPhone 13 is a new pair of upgraded cameras, along with the addition of 
                    pro-level image stabilization features found on the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The changes allow the lenses 
                    to take in more light, which means less noise and clearer photos in low-light conditions. Apple 
                    also added new video recording modes like “Cinematic mode,” which allows for easier and more 
                    automatic rack focusing.
