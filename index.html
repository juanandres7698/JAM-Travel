        <p>Community-based tourism focuses on experiences that are hosted by local residents in a way that does good for the whole area. It's not just a great idea for those we are visiting, either. Truth is, the reward for seeking out CBT (its <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/sustainable-destinations-2021">sustainable</a>-travel acronym) is that we get a deeper, more meaningful and textured insight into local cultures – with added positive impact from modelling the development of destinations in a way that’s more sustainable.</p>
        <p>Sure, one of the greatest rewards of travel is experiencing dramatically different <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-landscape-photographs-conde-nast-traveller">landscapes</a> and terrains. But what a buzz if our immersive travel experiences also address the economic inequalities in our world, which are all the more exaggerated by the pandemic. We hear the word stakeholder used increasingly, but in this context of travel, it's vital to know that an <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/article/indigenous-art-canada">Indigenous</a> community has had input on the planning, hosting and financial compensation of activities involving them. Sitting in an all-inclusive for a contrived scenario created for fleeting artificial performances for foreigners can't be compared to connecting with locals in their own environs. Community-based tourism is unmistakably more respectful. Sign up for excursions with social enterprises or turn to ethical operators who have planned trips in this way to treat travellers to a truer taste of far-flung cultures, while benefitting those who live in more <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/most-remote-places-on-earth">remote</a> destinations.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/rwanda-safari">Rwanda</a>’s ﬁrst community-owned lodge, Sabyinyo Silverback Lodge in the foothills of the Virungas, isn't only helping the preservation of the famous mountain gorilla – it also helps give an income to thousands of households. Owned by community trust SACOLA, this chic Governors’ Camp Collection property uses gorilla tourism to support many social and conservation initiatives in the Kinigi area of north-western Rwanda. <em> <a href="https://www.governorscamp.com/safari-camps/sabyinyo-silverback-lodge/" target="blank">governorscamp.com</a></em></p>
