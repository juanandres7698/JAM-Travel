        <h3>Sustainability editor Juliet Kinsman recommends community-based experiences designed specifically to benefit the places we visit, and their residents</h3>

        <p>Community-based tourism focuses on experiences that are hosted by local residents in a way that does good for the whole area. It's not just a great idea for those we are visiting, either. Truth is, the reward for seeking out CBT (its <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/sustainable-destinations-2021">sustainable</a>-travel acronym) is that we get a deeper, more meaningful and textured insight into local cultures – with added positive impact from modelling the development of destinations in a way that’s more sustainable.</p>
        <p>Sure, one of the greatest rewards of travel is experiencing dramatically different <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-landscape-photographs-conde-nast-traveller">landscapes</a> and terrains. But what a buzz if our immersive travel experiences also address the economic inequalities in our world, which are all the more exaggerated by the pandemic. We hear the word stakeholder used increasingly, but in this context of travel, it's vital to know that an <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/article/indigenous-art-canada">Indigenous</a> community has had input on the planning, hosting and financial compensation of activities involving them. Sitting in an all-inclusive for a contrived scenario created for fleeting artificial performances for foreigners can't be compared to connecting with locals in their own environs. Community-based tourism is unmistakably more respectful. Sign up for excursions with social enterprises or turn to ethical operators who have planned trips in this way to treat travellers to a truer taste of far-flung cultures, while benefitting those who live in more <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/most-remote-places-on-earth">remote</a> destinations.</p>

        <h2>Trailblazing gorilla safaris in Volcanoes National Park</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/rwanda-safari">Rwanda</a>’s ﬁrst community-owned lodge, Sabyinyo Silverback Lodge in the foothills of the Virungas, isn't only helping the preservation of the famous mountain gorilla – it also helps give an income to thousands of households. Owned by community trust SACOLA, this chic Governors’ Camp Collection property uses gorilla tourism to support many social and conservation initiatives in the Kinigi area of north-western Rwanda. <em> <a href="https://www.governorscamp.com/safari-camps/sabyinyo-silverback-lodge/" target="blank">governorscamp.com</a></em></p>

        <h2>Wildlife, waterfalls and hiking in Guyana</h2>
        <p>Surama, a village in the North Rupununi region of English-speaking Guyana, formerly British Guiana, was one of the first villages in the country to embrace community-led tourism. Journey Latin America takes you to this <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-hotels-resorts-caribbean-central-america">Caribbean</a> coastline in a way that supports the preservation of these Amerindian ancestral lands and their biodiversity. The 14-day Guyana Wildlife: <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-new-hotels-central-south-america">South America</a>’s Wild Frontier tour takes you to the Pakaraima Mountains and Burro Burro River and lets you have a spell in a back-to-basics <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-eco-friendly-hotels">eco</a>-lodge created using traditional Makushi craftsmanship. Head out on hikes and river-canoeing adventures knowing that your holiday is giving back. Staying in a simple thatched shack in a farming village may lack the polish and frills of luxury resorts, but such experiences make your escapes all the more enriching – you know that your time away is leaving cash in local pockets while you’re treated to authentic, soul-lifting encounters that promise the longest-lasting memories. <em><a href="https://www.journeylatinamerica.co.uk/destinations/guyana/holidays/guyana-wildlife-south-americas-wild-frontier/" target="blank">journeylatinamerica.co.uk</a></em></p>
