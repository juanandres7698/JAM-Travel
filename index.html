                Community-based tourism focuses on experiences that are hosted by local residents in a way that does 
                good for the whole area. It's not just a great idea for those we are visiting, either. Truth is, the 
                reward for seeking out CBT (its 
                <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/sustainable-destinations-2021">sustainable</a>-travel 
                acronym) is that we get a deeper, more meaningful and textured insight into local cultures – with added 
                positive impact from modelling the development of destinations in a way that’s more sustainable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sure, one of the greatest rewards of travel is experiencing dramatically different 
                <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-landscape-photographs-conde-nast-traveller">landscapes</a> 
                and terrains. But what a buzz if our immersive travel experiences also address the economic 
                inequalities in our world, which are all the more exaggerated by the pandemic. We hear the word 
                stakeholder us increasingly, but in this context of travel, it's vital to know that an 
                <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/article/indigenous-art-canada">Indigenous</a> community has had 
                input on the planning, hosting and financial compensation of activities involving them. Sitting in an 
                all-inclusive for a contrived scenario created for fleeting artificial performances for foreigners 
                can't be compared to connecting with locals in their own environs. Community-based tourism is 
                unmistakably more respectful. 
                Sign up for excursions with social enterprises or turn to ethical operators who have planned trips in 
                this way to treat travellers to a truer taste of far-flung cultures, while benefitting those who live 
                in more <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/most-remote-places-on-earth">remote</a> 
                destinations.

                    Surama, a village in the North Rupununi region of English-speaking Guyana, formerly British Guiana, 
                    was one of the first villages in the country to embrace community-led tourism. Journey Latin

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Preserving ancient weaving traditions among the Ccaccaccollo community in <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/article/peru-denise-pozzi-escot-locals-guide">Peru</a>'s Sacred Valley supports 
                    many Quechua-speaking families and provides precious protection for their traditional way of life. 
                    Even though this Andean enclave is close to Cuzco and <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/machu-picchu-peru-tours-andes">Machu Picchu</a>,
                    few tourists came here in the past. Now, thanks to 
                    Planeterra, the non-profit partner of G Adventures, the project features in lots of the travel 
                    company’s small-group itineraries, drawing hundreds of travellers a year for a weaving 
                    demonstration and the chance to buy the handicrafts loomed in front of them by the artisans. Also 
                    thanks to this cooperative, the craftspeople are the first generation of women from these 
                    Indigenous people to be completely literate in Spanish.

                <p>
                    Cempedak and Nikoi are postcard-perfect private-island resorts in the
                    <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/south-china-sea-islands">South China Sea</a>,
                    just seven miles and five miles off the east coast of Bintan. They’ve developed a way of hosting 
                    guests at their characterful luxury nature-living 
                    <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-hotels-in-europe-2020">resorts</a> 
                    that directly benefits the Orang Suka Laut seafaring people of the Johore Strait, here in the Riau 
                    Archipelago. By heading out for an on-water excursion with these semi-nomadic Indigenous people – 
                    their name translates as ‘sea people’ – guests get a window into their lives of spearfishing and 
                    crafting fishing nets. This initiative has also helped convert the Orang Suka Laut from poachers to 
                    activists – instead of hunting endangered dugongs, they've become their protectors. Jaslan Button, 
                    who runs the resorts' watersports, succeeded in turning one of the last hunters into a guide. The 
                    government had been trying to achieve such goals in the area for a long time but hadn't been 
                    totally successful. While the hotel isn’t owned by the community as such, everyone who works there, 
                    except for a guest relations manager, is Indonesian. The savings and loans scheme has also helped 
                    members of the team to save and borrow at more favourable rates than those available from local 
                    banks, transforming their lives and futures.

                    Giving the rural residents prospects in Myanmar

                <p>
                    This military-run South-east Asian country isn’t a destination to travel to at the moment and it has
                    a bad reputation in terms of human rights and politics. But that doesn't make the poorest of the 
                    population in its least-developed regions any less deserving of help when tourism recovers. One of 
                    the best ways to help those in need will be to visit Myaing with Intrepid Travel. Amid off-grid 
                    farming villages characterised by maize and muddy oxen, the country’s first community-based tourism 
                    project was set up a few years before the pandemic hit. It’s only a two-hour drive from 
                    UNESCO-protected Bagan in the Mandalay Region, but life here, in contrast, was about growing 
                    sesame, sunflower and pigeon pea crops. It’s a hard way to earn a living, and many young residents 
                    head to the cities in search of jobs. Now, thanks to Intrepid’s partnership with ActionAid Myanmar,
                    communities in SuLae Pan, Inn Yaung and KanGyi Taw are looking forward to hosting visitors again in 
                    charming, rustic lodges.

                    Community homestays in the UNESCO-recognised village of Panauti saw family homes opening to 
                    accommodate guests, encouraging rural Nepalese women to step out of their kitchens to receive 
                    language lessons and learn how to run a tourism service. Beds piled with pillows and hand-loomed 
                    blankets allow a privileged chance to experience true Newari life, and with your hosts you’ll cook 
                    vegetables and meat from the market, to eat together. Inviting foreigners into villagers’ home 
                    environments relieves overtourism in Kathmandu and results in direct-action wealth distribution.

                    thousands of flora and fauna species over the years. During the pandemic, they really proved the 
                    power of purpose-driven agritourism businesses such as this to support their community – a farmers’ 
                    market popped up, and they were able to provide food security for local people with produce grown
